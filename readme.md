# RomanNumeralFun

For now, only contains a script to convert roman numerals to an integer.

This script currently doesn't prevent invalid roman numerals from being converted (ex: 99 can be written as XCIX, but not IC)

I also still want to make an int => roman numeral script, but we'll save these remaining tasks for another midnight coding session.
